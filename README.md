# Course Learning Platform

## Objective

Develop a responsive, interactive course learning page using HTML and Bootstrap. The page aims to serve as a comprehensive platform for users to engage with various learning materials organized into sections and subsections. A central feature of this platform will be a multimedia player, allowing users to access video and audio content with basic controls. Additionally, the platform will include language selection functionality to cater to a global audience.

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Design

Ensure compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices by leveraging Bootstrap's grid system. The responsive design aims to provide an optimal viewing experience for users on different devices.

### 2. Course Structure

Implement a clear and intuitive hierarchy with main sections and detailed subsections. Navigation features will be incorporated to facilitate easy access to different parts of the course, ensuring a seamless learning experience.

### 3. Multimedia Player

Integrate a multimedia player within subsections to enhance the learning experience. The player will support both video and audio content and include basic controls such as play, pause, and volume adjustment.

### 4. Language Selection

Enhance accessibility for a global audience by incorporating a language selection feature. Initially supporting English and one additional language of your choice, users can toggle between languages to tailor the interface to their preferences.
